```

## Import datasets

```{r}
litters_data = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_data = janitor::clean_names(litters_data)

pups_data = read_csv("./data/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_data = janitor::clean_names(pups_data)

```
# R doesn't know about the "group" variable inside of the litters dataset "litters_data". We need to tell R where to look: "pull(litters_data, group).


## Selecting

# If we only want to select certain columns (variables) from the dataset "litters_data", then use select():
```{r}
select(litters_data, group, litter_number)

select(litters_data, group, litter_number, gd0_weight)

# Can use a helper function like "starts_with" to tell R to select all columns from the dataset that start with "pups":
select(litters_data, group, litter_number, gd0_weight, starts_with("pups"))

select(litters_data, litter_number, group, gd0_weight)

# Tells R that we want litters_number, then group, then everything else to come after:
select(litters_data, litter_number, group, everything())

# Tells R that we want all the columns in the dataset selected EXCEPT for group (denoted by the -):
select(litters_data, -group)

# Keeps litter_number, then extract every column from my dataset between gd0_weight and pups_born_alive:
select(litters_data, litter_number, gd0_weight:pups_born_alive)

# We can rename column names with the select function too (but again, this isn't permanent):
select(litters_data, GROUP = group, litter_number)

# We can also rename column names with the rename() function (this also is not permanent!):
rename(litters_data, GROUP = group)

```
# Note that with selecting, we aren't making any changes to the existing dataframe unless we make a new df. 


## Filtering

# If we only want to select certain columns (variables) from the dataset "litters_data", then use select():

```{r}
filter(litters_data, group == "Con7")

filter(litters_data, gd_of_birth == 20)

filter(litters_data, gd_of_birth < 20)

filter(litters_data, gd_of_birth >= 20)

filter(litters_data, pups_born_alive < 6)

filter(litters_data, pups_born_alive < 6, group == "Con7")

# We want to filter for pups that survive that aren't equal to 4:
filter(litters_data, pups_survive != 4)

# Can use not and have the function inside the ():
# !(pups_survive == 4)

# If we want to filter for "Con7" or "Mod8":
filter(litters_data, group == "Con7" | group == "Mod8")
# This is equivalent to the or function above, but Prof. prefers this one: 
filter(litters_data, group %in% c("Con7", "Mod8"))

filter(litters_data, pups_born_alive >= 4, pups_born_alive <= 6)

# If we want to filter for groups where the sum of gd0_weight and gd18_weight is less than 70:
filter(litters_data, gd0_weight + gd18_weight < 70)

# DO NOT DO THIS:
filter(litters_data, !is.na(gd0_weight))

# Instead, do this (tells R that we want to drop the missing values for "gd0_weight" in the "litters_data" dataframe:
drop_na(litters_data, gd0_weight)

```
